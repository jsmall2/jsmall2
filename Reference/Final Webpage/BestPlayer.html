	Growing up, Subban was good friends with the first overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, John Tavares.
	 Malcolm is a goaltender who was selected by the Boston Bruins in the first round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Jordan was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the fourth round of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.
