Montreal Canadiens are a hockey team that plays in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Canadiens are the only team to have been continuously operating throughout the entirety of the NHL, and are the only existing NHL club to have formed prior to the NHL. The Canadiens play in Bell Centre (present capacity 21 273) in Montreal, Quebec.
Early History of Hockey in Montreal
Regulated senior hockey first arrived in Montreal thanks to students at McGill University, who began playing an unstructured form of hockey on Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink in 1875. By 1880, the group had written a set of rules for teams to follow, and in 1886 helped to organize the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), which included teams from four teams from Montreal, and one team from Ottawa; a team from Quebec would join the league in 1892. One Montreal team, the Montreal Hockey Club, won the first Stanley Cup awarded in 1893. At a time when any team in Canada could challenge for the Cup at any time during the season, Montreal teams would continue to dominate the Stanley Cup wins, with the Montreal Hockey Club winning again in 1894 and 1895, and the Montreal Victorias winning in 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, and 1899.
When CAHA folded in 1898, it was reorganized as the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). During its first two years in operation in 1899 and 1900, the Montreal Shamrocks, league's top team, defended the Stanley Cup four times in that period. The Montreal Hockey Club reclaimed its Stanley Cup victories in 1902 and 1903. In 1905 the CAHL was replaced by the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). The Montreal Wanderers then proved to be the Montreal team to beat, as they successfully defended the Cup six times in 1907 and 1908.
In 1909, the ECAHA dissolved, and reformed as the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA). The Montreal Wanderers were excluded from the new league, and as a result, formed their own league, the National Hockey Association (NHA). By February 1910, the CHA merged into the NHA.
